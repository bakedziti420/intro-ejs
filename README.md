# Intro to EJS

Today we will introduce EJS: a tool that will save you time and DRY out your code by allowing you to use the power of Javascript inside your HTML views.  Let's get started!

## Getting started

Inside the starter-code folder is some HTML generated by concatenating a whole bunch of HTML strings together.  Wouldn't it be great if we could make this HTML appear without creating a giant string and appending it to our page?  Well we can, with EJS!

## Directions

1. First, we need to install the `express` and `ejs` packages with `npm install`.  
2. Now, take a look at `localhost:3000` to see what we're trying to build.
2. To pull this messy string out of our app, we should create a `class.ejs` file.  Creating an EJS file will allow us to bring the power of JS into an HTML template.
3. Let's put our first line of HTML, the `title` property, into our new `class.ejs` file.
  - It should look like this: `<h1><%= title %></h1>`
  - **Note:** `<%= ... %>` means "execute JS and print out the result" in EJS
4. Now, let's hook it up to our app!
  - First, comment out the unwieldy `html` string in `app.js`.
  - Next, we will replace the string with our EJS rendering.
  - It should look like this: `ejs.renderFile('./class.ejs', data, function(err,str) {html = str;});`
  - **Note:** `str` is the result of converting the EJS to pure HTML.
5. Finally, let's let the power of EJS really fly by utilizing our friend, the `for` loop, *inside* our `class.ejs` file, to print out all our class supplies.  Use the commented-out `html` string for inspiration.  It should look like this:
```html
  <ul>
    <% for(var i=0; i<supplies.length; i++) { %>
      <li>
        <a href='supplies/<%= supplies[i] %>'>
          <%= supplies[i] %>
        </a>
      </li>
    <% } %>
  </ul>
```

**Note:** `<% ... %>` means "execute JS and **do not** print out the result" in EJS
